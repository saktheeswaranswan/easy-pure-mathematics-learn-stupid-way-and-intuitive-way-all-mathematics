Below is a comprehensive, multi‐table “catalog” that organizes many of the central theorems and ideas across several major areas of mathematics—in Artin’s Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, Topology (in the style of Munkres), Category Theory, and Algebraic Geometry—through the lens of “quotienting, collapsing, limiting, reduction, and contraction” techniques. In each table the columns include: the theorem or result, its field, the key technique(s) used (with an informal intuition versus the formal formulation), and a brief explanation or reference note. (Keep in mind that many of these ideas appear implicitly in proofs and constructions; this tabulation is a conceptual guide rather than an exhaustive textbook indexing.)

1. Artin’s Abstract Algebra
(Inspired by Michael Artin’s approach, many proofs and constructions in groups, rings, modules, and fields rely on collapsing structures (by “modding out” substructures) and taking limits in a categorical sense.)
Theorem/Result
Field
Key Technique(s)
Informal vs. Formal Explanation
Reference/Notes
First Isomorphism Theorem
Group Theory
Quotienting, Collapsing
Informally “collapse the kernel to a point” to identify the structure of the image. Formally, G/kerφ≅Imφ.
Artin’s Abstract Algebra (Chapter on Groups)
Lagrange’s Theorem
Group Theory
Quotienting (via Cosets)
Partitions a finite group into cosets; each coset is an “equivalence class” under the subgroup relation.
Standard result in group theory
Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups
Abelian Groups
Decomposition, Reduction
Breaks an abelian group into a direct sum of cyclic groups by “reducing” the group’s structure to its simplest cyclic factors.
Artin; many texts on finite abelian groups
Jordan–Hölder Theorem

Discussed in Artin and many advanced algebra texts
Structure Theorem for Finitely Generated Modules
Module Theory
Quotienting, Reduction
Expresses a module as a quotient of a free module by a well-chosen submodule—collapsing redundant information to yield invariants (e.g., invariant factors).
Artin’s treatment of module theory; see also texts on modules
Chinese Remainder Theorem
Ring Theory
Quotienting, Modular Techniques
Relates a ring to a product of quotient rings. Informally “splits” the ring along ideals, thereby reducing a complex structure to simpler components.
Classical theorem; Artin and many algebra texts

2. Real Analysis
(Key results here often rely on limiting processes—taking sequences, limits of functions, and covering arguments—which in turn “collapse” more complex behavior into a manageable form.)
Theorem/Result
Focus Area
Key Technique(s)
Intuition vs. Formal Structure
Reference/Notes
Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem
Sequences/Compactness
Limiting
Every bounded sequence “clusters” around a limit point. Formally, any bounded sequence in Rn has a convergent subsequence.
Standard in analysis texts
Intermediate Value Theorem
Continuity
Reduction (via connectedness)
A continuous function “collapses” the interval between values—if it takes two values it must take every value in between.
Often used to argue the existence of roots
Heine–Borel Theorem
Compactness
Covering/Reduction
Characterizes compact sets as those that can be “reduced” to a finite subcover from any open cover.
A cornerstone in real analysis

Limiting
Any monotonic bounded sequence converges, as its limit “collapses” the infinite tail into a single value.
Classical result in introductory analysis
Dominated Convergence Theorem
Integration/Measure
Limiting, Reduction
Enables “passing the limit” under the integral sign by collapsing function differences using an integrable dominating function.
Key result in Lebesgue integration theory

3. Topology (Munkres Approach)
(Munkres’ texts emphasize constructing new spaces by “gluing” or “collapsing” parts, as well as using limits and coverings for characterizing spaces.)
Theorem/Result
Focus Area
Key Technique(s)
Informal vs. Formal Description
Reference/Notes
Urysohn’s Lemma
Normal Spaces
Contraction, Extension (Collapsing distances)
Informally constructs a continuous function that “separates” disjoint closed sets; it collapses the set differences into distinct function values.
Munkres’ Topology
Tietze Extension Theorem
Normal Spaces
Extension via Collapsing
Shows that any continuous function defined on a closed subset can be “extended” to the whole space; conceptually this extends and “collapses” local behavior consistently.
Munkres’ Topology
Tychonoff Theorem
Product Spaces, Compactness
Limiting (via ultrafilters or nets)
Characterizes the compactness of a product of spaces using a general limiting process, underscoring that infinite products “limit” into a compact structure.
A classical theorem in topology; proof techniques vary
Seifert–van Kampen Theorem
Fundamental Group
Quotienting (by decomposing spaces)
Computes the fundamental group of a space by “gluing” open sets together, each collapsing non-essential paths to a point in the quotient construction.
Munkres and algebraic topology textbooks
Classification of Compact Surfaces
2D Topology
Reduction, Quotienting
Uses identification and “gluing” (i.e., quotient spaces) of edges in polygons to classify surfaces into canonical types.
Standard result; often included in advanced topology discussions

4. Category Theory
(Category theory abstracts the ideas of “gluing,” “factoring,” and “limiting” to a very high level through universal properties and the concept of limits/colimits.)
Theorem/Result
Focus Area
Key Technique(s)
Conceptual Framework
Reference/Notes
Yoneda Lemma
Representable Functors
Limiting/Universal Property
Provides a bridge between objects and functors; it “collapses” the categorical structure into set-theoretic terms via representable functors.
Standard in category theory texts
Adjoint Functor Theorem
Existence of Adjoints
Limiting/Co/Limit Constructions
Uses universal properties and limit-colimit duality to capture “optimal” extensions or reductions between categories.
Foundational in category theory
Universal Properties (Limits & Colimits)
All of Category Theory
Quotienting, Limiting, Collapsing
The definitions of limits (inverse limits) and colimits (direct limits) generalize the idea of “collapsing” diagrams into a universal object that satisfies a certain property.
Core theme in any categorical text
Factorization Systems
Morphism Analysis
Reduction/Decomposition
Decomposes any morphism into a composition of two morphisms (often an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism), “reducing” the morphism structure.
Common in the study of concrete and abstract categories

5. Algebraic Geometry
(Many key ideas in algebraic geometry are built on quotient constructions—identifying points via equivalence relations—and limiting procedures to “glue” local data into global objects.)
Theorem/Result
Focus Area
Key Technique(s)
Intuition vs. Formalism
Reference/Notes

Relates algebraic sets to ideals in polynomial rings. Informally, one “collapses” algebraic information of zero sets into ideal-theoretic data.
Fundamental result; standard in algebraic geometry texts

Central to the study of curves and surfaces
Scheme Gluing
Scheme Theory
Quotienting, Limit Processes
Builds global schemes by “gluing” affine pieces via equivalence relations, thereby reducing local ringed spaces into a coherent global object.
Introduced by Grothendieck; found in standard texts on schemes
Resolution of Singularities
Varieties/Complex Geometry
Collapse/Reduction
The process “contracts” singular parts to replace them by smoother pieces; a careful limiting procedure reconstructs the variety in a smooth form.
A major topic in modern algebraic geometry
Serre’s GAGA Principle
Analytic vs. Algebraic
Equivalence (Collapsing distinctions)
Establishes an equivalence between the algebraic and analytic categories over complex projective varieties, “collapsing” the differences between these perspectives.
A bridge in advanced algebraic geometry and complex analysis

Concluding Remarks
Each of these tables highlights how similar conceptual techniques—whether they are thought of as “quotienting,” “collapsing,” “limiting,” “reduction,” or “contraction”—play a central role in unifying seemingly diverse areas of mathematics. In Artin’s Abstract Algebra, the emphasis is on modding out substructures to simplify algebraic objects; in Real Analysis and Topology, limiting processes and covering arguments reduce infinite or complex structures to manageable forms; in Category Theory, universal constructions generalize these ideas to an abstract setting; and in Algebraic Geometry, equivalence relations and gluing via limits build global geometric objects from local data.
These canonical tables are intended as a conceptual map—a “meta‐theory” of mathematical simplification techniques that recur across disciplines. For precise theorem statements, proofs, and further contextual details, consulting the primary texts (e.g., Artin’s Algebra, Munkres’ Topology, Mac Lane’s Categories for the Working Mathematician, and Hartshorne’s Algebraic Geometry) is recommended.
